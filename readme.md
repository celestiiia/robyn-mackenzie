PLEASE NOTE:
all website files exist within the public folder

all other files and folders are for the purpose of deploying the website to firebase via github

!! the media folder within the public folder contains all video assets, 
but the pages themselves display them through vimeo 
(this is also due to restriction on the deployment pipeline)
