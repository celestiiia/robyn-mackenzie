        <h2>the project part i;</h2>
        <br>
        <p>
          This project was completely up my street. We initially started with
          more conceptual work, in a group of 4 we had to use the Post Growth
          Toolkit to reimagine our given object in a post-growth society. Our
          given object was MRI scanners, and as you can see from the process
          pages, it was quite the journey from the MRI scanner to a new approach
          healthcare system.
        </p>

        <p>
          This project helped to solidify my passion for research and conceptual
          design, creating a tangible system that does good. Digital and design
          transformation is at the core of the projects that interest me.
        </p>
        <br />

        <h2>the project part ii;</h2>
        <br>
        <p>
          The branding of this concept was truly fun. We were lucky enough to
          get to speak to the team at Imagination, Wes and Becca, to get
          feedback throughout the branding process on what ideas would work
          best.
        </p>

        <p>
          We came up with individual initial ideas, my main approach was a
          mascot-focused design, I wanted to make it youthful and fun, a direct
          contrast to current healthcare approaches. Using a dog as the mascot
          was a way to foster a sense of loyalty from the start, and pose the
          brand as a trustworthy friend. I utilised both bright and pastel
          colours, each focused on a different aspect of wellbeing.
        </p>

        <p>
          My mascot design and logo were not ultimately selected, however, my
          wordmark, primary typeface and colour palette were! This was combined
          with a fellow team member's logo and secondary typeface to make up our
          final brand. We collaborated and tested different uses as a group and
          created our end presentation. I mainly focused on the creation of copy
          for mockups, brand partnerships, and a website mockup for this, as
          well as the editorial of the presentation itself. The presentation was
          very well received and was a great taste of pitching in a professional
          environment.
