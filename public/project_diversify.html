        <h2>the project;</h2>
        <br>
        <p>
        This project was one of our final projects in the first year of my
        graphic design degree. We visited the 
		Hauser & Wirth Bruton Gallery
        and had to choose one of 3 briefs to address. Despite being one of the
        most diverse galleries, Bruton especially did not express enough about
        the artists from minority backgrounds to us as visitors.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Our concept was a cultural program culminating in an exhibition to try
        and tackle the problems we found within the art world upon further
        research, centring H&W as the flagship gallery for this revolution.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I was responsible for visualising the concept of the unveiling
        artwork, creating a GIF in Photoshop showing the art projections being
        unveiled and artists' info being revealed. I created a working Figma
        prototype for buying tickets for the expo. This was a fun challenge
        for me, I’ve previously used Adobe XD and Figma was an interesting
        challenge- certainly one I want to explore more. The prototype is
        rough around the edges but gets the concept across well. </p>
        <br>
        <p>I was also very involved in our presentation, ensuring it had the same
        tone throughout and flowed well despite being a mix of everybody’s
        input. I took an editorial approach to this part of the project.
